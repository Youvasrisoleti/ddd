Project Overview  
In today’s digital learning landscape, sustaining motivation and tracking progress often pose challenges for learners—especially in self-paced environments. 
Traditional learning dashboards tend to fall short when it comes to offering personalized, gamified, and real-time feedback experiences. 
Our mission is to change that. We’re building Vibe, an interactive learning dashboard designed to stimulate learner motivation through dopamine-boosting features and goal-oriented engagement.
